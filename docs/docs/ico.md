## Distribution {#distribution}
 
Total initial supply is **18 000 000 APN**, which is distributed in following way:
 
* **7 200 000 APN** [40%] will be given away to validators over 2 years counting from mainnet start.  
   Airdrops will be deposited directly on Apini Chain every week evenly distributing 69 230 APN between active validators. (On top of standard validator staking reward)
 
* **7 200 000 APN** [40%] will be exchanged for BNB over a period of 170 days (40 000 APN per day).  
No matter the price, every day 40 000 APN (BEP-20) will be swapped for BNB on PancakeSwap. This part is the main source of funding for project.
 
* **1 800 000 APN** [10%] will be frozen in the Innovation Fund.  
APN will be released lineary over span of **10 years** (15 000 APN per month). Purpose of Innovation Fund is to provide support in longer timeframe (bug bounty program, donations for other open source projects and apini development)
 
* **1 800 000 APN** [10%] will be distributed between development team in following way:  
1) **1 725 000 APN** in form of first 25k validators on main chain required for PoS consensus  
2) **75 000 APN** in form of BEP-20 APN token
 
## ICO sale {#ico-sale}
 
In order to grow the development team apini decided to go with the public sale of APN instead of looking for private investors.
We believe this will help to achieve better APN distribution and security for the Apini Chain.
 
Total amount of APN minted in form of BEP-20 is **7 275 000**.  
Innovation Fund, first validators stake and airdrops for validators will exist only in the form of native APN on Apini Chain.
 
Distribution of **7 200 000 APN** (BEP-20) will take place as a regular daily sale of 40 000 APN over 170 days on PancakeSwap.
No matter the price of BNB/APN 40 000 APN per day will be exchanged for BNB. 
We prefer to do it this way as it's very important to achieve as good distribution of APN as possible.
We want to deliver on a technical level rather than overhype it so it makes more sense to have ICO spanning 170 days.
 
First **400 000 APN** together with **10 BNB** will be used to create a liquidity pool on pair APN/BNB. 
Starting from 22.11.2021 until 11.05.2022 we will do a daily swap of 40 000 APN.

## Swapping BEP-20 to native APN {#swapping-bep20-to-native}
 
APN is cryptocurrency with it's own blockchain but to make it easy and because we are starting ICO before mainnet, at the beginning part of it will exist in form of BEP-20 token on Binance Smart Chain.  

1 BEP-20 APN is equal to 1 APN on native chain. With start of mainnet every owner of BEP-20 APN will be able to exchange it for native equivalent, it's one way operation which have to happen before **1st of January 2023**.  
Any APN which will not be claimed before this date will be burned.  
Exact details on how to do swap will be announced before mainnet starts.
