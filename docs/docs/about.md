## About {#about}
 
Apini's goal is to create decentralized high frequency cryptocurrency exchange and other financial services platform.
We want to merge together security of decentralized blockchain with accessibility of centralized exchange.
 
## History {#history}
Idea for apini originated in 2013. Since then a lot changed in crypto space and many exchanges failed bringing losses to their customers. We believe there is a high probability of such scenarios repeating itself. With apini we want to utilize the public blockchain as foundation and security layer. At the same time bringing accessibility and user experience level which is expected from a centralized system.
 
Apini is founded by Marcin JÄ™druchniewicz ([@mjedruchniewicz](https://twitter.com/mjedruchniewicz)) who is a software developer for 14 years with the last five in the banking industry.
