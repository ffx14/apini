The roadmap is not written in stone. It's just our expectation of a timeline for bigger milestones, it might be updated in future.
:::
 

1. **01.12.2021** - Mainnet for main chain  
It will be the moment when everyone will be able to exchange their BEP-20 APN to native APN and start running PoS validators.
Main goal from now on will be to get good decentralization / distribution of validators. It's very important for the security of chains going forward.

2. **01.02.2022** - Decentralized bridge with Ethereum  
Decentralized bridges between chains will be a way for getting assets onto apini, we will start with Ethereum and roll more in future.

3. **01.03.2022** - Spot trading  
Decentralized high frequency spot trading. Operator chain will already work at this point but all nodes will be managed by the apini team. Operator chain will be validated and penalized on the main chain.

4. **Q2 2022** - Borrowing & Lending  
Decentralized borrowing and lending directly on the main chain.

5. **Q2 2022** - Perpetual contracts trading  
Decentralized perpetual contracts with leverage.

6. **Q2-Q3 2022** - Roll more decentralized bridges  
Goal is to have decentralized bridges to all popular chains supporting smart contracts. Like: BSC, Solana, Polkadot, Cardano and more.

7. **Q3 2022** - Decentralizing operators  
Allowing anyone to become operator(validator) on the operator chain.

8. **Q3 2022** - Mobile application 

9. **Q3 2022** - Auction transfers  
Auction transfers is a way to get assets in & out of apini in fastests and cheapest possible way.
Goal is to have a way for inter-chain transfers without using bridges.

10. **Q3 2022** - Bring coins from chains without smart contracts  
Bring BTC, LTC, DOGE to apini

11. **Q4 2022** - Validator stake as collateral 

12. **Q4 2022** - Apini Pay  
Provide an easy to use billing platform so anyone could integrate crypto payments into their shops / products and services.
